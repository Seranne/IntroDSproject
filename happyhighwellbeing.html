###Happy Highs



##Exploring the realm of 
population-level well-being and happiness




What do we mean? 
Who are we? We are three students of BST 260: Introduction to Data Science, at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health. We are relentless optimists, and believe that human happiness and well-being is a complex and nuanced measure, relying on a network of factors that go deep into our physical, mental, social, and cultural environments.
How did we do this? We are inspired by the United Nations World Happiness Report, developed by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, but believe that in the changing political and societal climates of today, our happiness and well-being is determined by additional measures which both influence and are influenced by the human experience. With this in mind, we used data from a number of categories, enlisted below, to bolster our new, more inclusive, Country-wise well-being index.
